# There is no patch for stupidity.

I was previously part of the development team at **BLOODSTONE LLC** (Russia).  
The work was internal, non-public, and not intended for showcasing.

My involvement focused on Lua-based solutions operating in hostile, unstable,  
and detection-aware environments where mistakes are expensive  
and undefined behavior is never theoretical.

## 🧪 What I Actually Do

Within a team, I usually take the role of a tester   
not the checkbox kind, but the one who actively tries to break the product.

My work has been focused specifically on **Lua script Bloodstone LLC (bs.lua)** developed *for* platforms such as  
**[gamesense.pub](https://gamesense.pub) / [skeet.cc](https://skeet.cc)**   
not the platforms themselves.

Across all stages of support and maintenance for **Lua script**,  
my focus has been on real runtime behavior rather than ideal execution paths.

I challenge assumptions early, stress rarely exercised logic paths,  
and intentionally misuse systems to observe how they fail under pressure.
My goal is to identify unstable states and edge cases  
before they surface for end users.


Development was carried out in close collaboration with:
- [Shunko](https://github.com/ccsimplyspolit)  

The priority was never public presentation  
it was whether the script remained predictable under pressure.
