# There is no patch for stupidity.

I was previously part of the development team at **BLOODSTONE LLC** (Russia).  
The work was internal, non-public, and not intended for showcasing.

My involvement focused on Lua-based solutions operating in hostile, unstable,  
and detection-aware environments where mistakes are expensive  
and undefined behavior is never theoretical.

## 🧪 What I Actually Do

Within a team, I usually take the role of a tester  
not the checkbox kind, but the one who actively tries to break the product.

Across all stages of support and maintenance for platforms like  
**[gamesense.pub](https://gamesense.pub) / [skeet.cc](https://skeet.cc)**, my focus has been on real behavior, not ideal scenarios.

I question assumptions early.  
I stress logic paths that are rarely exercised.  
I intentionally misuse systems to see where they bend and where they snap.

What happens when the environment changes mid-runtime?  
When callbacks arrive out of order?  
When state desynchronizes but execution continues?

My job is to find those moments before users do.

Development was carried out in close collaboration with:
- [Akzor](https://github.com/akzor) 
- [Shunko](https://github.com/ccsimplyspolit)  

The priority was never public presentation  
it was whether the script remained predictable under pressure.
